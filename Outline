Build three datasets

1. Where the price goes up
2. Where the price goes down
3. Stays about even

Let the agent buy and sell accordingly.
Assumptions:
    1. If you buy, buy at ask value. Therefore you lower the depth of the ask value
    2. If the ask value changes by the time you buy then you must ad to orderbook, and will only buy if that
        values gets bought (else in limit orders after a minute it will be taken back)
